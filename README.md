# v.0.0.0.1
Rough Draft of Concept
>> Concept is to enable ease of document management and track changes of documents whole also ensuring top level security to protect integrity of the documents.
>> End user must be focus of the design and not be strayed from.
>> UX/UI must come after functional design is complete
>> No money will be spent or raised till the MVP is functional.
>> No dashboard is needed: server, terminal, multiple user with different rights (user, moderator, admin, super admin)
>> System must run flawless but ugly
>> System must be light weight
>> Basic form will be Open Source, security will come at cost and ensure compatibility
>> MVP will use VMWare to simulate paired machine
